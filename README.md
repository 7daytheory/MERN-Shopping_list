A Shopping list I created used a MERN Stock along with bootstrap/react-strap, redux, axios, thunk, and body-parser.

Simply add items to your shopping list whenever you know you will need more of next time you go to the store.
At the store you can open this up and remove items as you put them in your cart so you never miss an item!
