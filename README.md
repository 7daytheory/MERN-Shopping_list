# (Matt's) Shopping List

A Shopping list application I created used a MERN Stack along with bootstrap/react-strap, redux, axios, thunk, and body parser.

Simply add items to your shopping list whenever you know you will need more of next time you go to the store.
At the store you can open this up and remove items as you put them in your cart so you never miss an item!

# Setup

Download the files and cd or equivalent into the main folder. Run and npm install to get all the node_modules required on the server side.
Then cd into the client folder and do the same.

# MongoDB Link

Right now this only supports one person as it was just one of the projects I have worked on to get more and more efficient with React.
I will come back to this and add separate users so you won't have to do this but you will have to add your own link to a MongoDB as we all can't use mine :)
